# Context7 Research Playbook

## When to use

- Implementing new integration with external library
- Migrating dependency version
- Fixing runtime errors tied to API misuse

## When not to use

- Project-specific business logic
- Local coding standards and style decisions
- Internal workflow policy

## Minimal retrieval loop

1. Resolve target library id
2. Fetch docs for exact feature being implemented
3. Extract actionable API guidance
4. Apply and verify through tests
